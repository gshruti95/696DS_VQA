Here are some of instruction on how to keep making changes to the code base:
1. For architecture changes, observe the interface followed by baseline.py in architectures folder.
    The forward function uses the following interface:
    image are passed as Variable of type torch.FloatTensor or torch.cuda.FloatTensor depending on the mode in which the code is executed.

    The forward function returns the scores obtained and DOES NOT APPLY ANY SOFTMAX LAYER IN THE ARCHITECTURE. Returns a variable of dimensions (N, class_size)

2. When adding a new architecture to the codebase, place it in the architectures folder and update the definitions in the net_factory.py.
    Update the enum value for MOdelType in enums.py

3. When adding a new dataset, follow the same folder hierarchy as mentioned in the README. The question json files follow the same structure.
    Update the definitions in data_loader_factory.py file with appropriate changes.
    Update the DataLoaderType in enums.py
    Add the following in config.py: 
        new DATASET_PATH
        new DATASET_DICTIONARY
        new DATASET_QUESTION_FILES dictionary
